          Project Overview:{" "}
          <span className="font-extralight block">
            Designed the complete product packaging for "Naturesmed Herbal
            Health Tea," a new herbal medicinal product from a Nigerian
            pharmaceutical company. The goal was to create visually appealing
            and compliant packaging that effectively communicates the product's
            natural benefits and stands out in the competitive health supplement
            market.

          <span className="font-extralight block">
            The client, a Nigerian pharmaceutical company, needed distinctive
            and compliant packaging for their new herbal health tea to ensure
            market acceptance and effectively convey its natural,
            health-promoting properties. The challenge was to balance aesthetic
            appeal with regulatory requirements and cultural relevance for the
            Nigerian market.

          Our Role:{" "}

            As the Graphics Design Expert in a three-person team, it was our

            of the packaging. This included creating the overall layout,
            selecting typography, designing graphic elements, and ensuring brand
            consistency across all packaging components. We collaborated closely
            with the marketing specialist for content and the regulatory expert
            for compliance.

          Design & Testing:{" "}

            The design process involved several iterations, starting with mood
            boards and rough sketches to establish a visual direction. Multiple
            packaging concepts were developed, focusing on themes of nature,
            wellness, and traditional Nigerian elements. These concepts were
            presented to the client for feedback. We conducted informal "shelf
            appeal" tests by placing mock-ups alongside competitor products to
            assess visibility and impact. Feedback from both the client and
            internal team members guided refinements to the typography, color
            palette, and imagery until a final design was approved. Emphasis was
            placed on ensuring legibility of critical information like dosage,
            ingredients, and NAFDAC registration details.
